# 🔍 main_GAM: Adaptation follow human attention: Gaze-assisted medical segment anything model

A PyTorch implementation of **main_GAM**, a novel Gaze-assisted medical segment anything model (GAM) designed to improve deep neural network performance by adaptively enhancing important spatial and channel features. This repository includes training and testing scripts for reproducible experiments.

## 📌 Highlights

- 🧠 **GAM Module**: Introduces a lightweight yet effective attention mechanism that separately models spatial and channel-wise features, then fuses them via a dual-branch architecture.
- ⚙️ **Plug-and-Play**: Can be seamlessly integrated into existing CNN backbones like ResNet.
- 🚀 **Performance Boost**: Demonstrated improved classification accuracy across multiple datasets with minimal computational overhead.
